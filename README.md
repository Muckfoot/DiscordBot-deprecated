# DiscordBot-deprecated
My first ever written Discordapp bot (written back in 2015 and is now deprecated).

I wrote this particular bot with the intention to learn Golang and to introduce additional features
which were not provided by Discord itself:

* Temporary bans
* Monitor user voice level and ban the user if certain treshold is reached (prevent raging while gaming)
* Log user messages and store them in the database
